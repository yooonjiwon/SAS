# [SAS] Fleiss
Before we perform the Fleiss, it is important to understand what is the inter and intra rater reliability.  
It is quite simple concept and commonly used in medical data.   
Also, analyses of Fleiss and Kripendorff's alpha are provided by the SAS macro file not the internal function.

## Inter - and intra rater reliability
It measures consistency in the data. 

### Inter-rater reliability
Measurement of consistencies between raters/judges/observers/coders.

### Intra-rater reliability
Measurement of consistencies in individuals' assessment.
